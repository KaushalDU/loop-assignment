Dear Client,

Thank you for reaching out to us about billing all your customers on Friday every week. I understand that you want to restrict billing to only Fridays.

To achieve this, you can use Shopify's built-in feature to set a specific billing schedule for your customers. 
Here's how you can set it up:

1.Go to your Shopify admin panel and navigate to Settings > Billing.
2.Click on "Billing schedules" and create a new schedule.
3.Set the billing schedule to "Weekly" and select "Friday" as the billing day.
4.Make sure to save your changes.

Please be aware that these changes will affect all customers, so be sure to inform them ahead of time.
If you need further assistance or have any questions about setting up your billing schedule, please feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
